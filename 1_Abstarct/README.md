# Advantages of E Commerce:

Looking at the brighter side however, e-commerce obviously has numerous advantages over traditional commerce, the number one advantage being convenience of use. The user can browse online stores, compare prices and order merchandise sitting at home on their PC. According to Forrester, 37 percent of online consumers use customer service more from Web retailers than traditional retailers because of its potential for ease of use and quick response times. "Once excellent proactive customer service is in place, merchants must build their brands around the promise of a satisfying experience," said Forrester's Christopher Kelley. "This means not only advertising a call center but also bragging about speedy response times and knowledgeable service reps". Dell, for example has adopted the same approach to selling their products both online and offline. This however, has proven beneficial for the company, since it helped them cut down on warehousing costs. One way in which the company has encouraged online ordering is by offering rebates on the products that are bought online. Other companies should follow Dell's example if they want to succeed in the online world.
